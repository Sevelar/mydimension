## Introduction
Tales of Neptunia was a fangame project originated in 2018. Starting as a simple walking simulator with Purple Heart and Black Heart from Hyperdimension Neptunia, it evolved into something looking like an actual video game. Featuring an action-based combat system, multiple characters and the world map - the project came to its end after 3 months of development, eventually being abandoned.

## The reason of the project's fall
There are many reasons why Tales of Neptunia eventually stopped progressing and failed. Bad organization, incompetent team and aiming too high were probably the biggest problems. The project was meant to be big from very beginning, which eventually led to its failure. Lack of knowledge, skills and experience of the development team proved that it's impossible to continue the project without spending a lot of time on learning how the engine works. Another problem was huge lack of any organization between teams working on the project. No team organization like Scrum or any other methodology shown that without any plan, it is completely pointless to work in a team, when you have nothing to do. I believe our Trello board proves this point enough.

## Project archiving
Since the project will be most likely no longer maintained, I have decided to archive this repository. You will still have access to the whole source code, but you won't be able to contribute to the project anymore. If you are interested in our work, you can fork this project and work with our codebase by yourself. With project archiving, we also will no longer accept new members in our development team, as we are finished with the project. However, our Trello and project documentation will remain opened to the public.

## Summary
With that all being said - I want to thank everyone, who decided to contribute to the project and take part in creating this fantastic piece of work. Maybe if our project was smaller, we could've actually finished it, but we indeed were too ambitious and not ready for this. I wanna wish you all a good luck in future projects you might take part in the near future. I have learnt a lot myself, now knowing how to manage a project or a team of people, but I didn't know it when I started this project. For the last words - Thank you, everyone!
